Hi! 
I am a third year PhD student at School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Southampton. I am broadly interested in Probabilistic Numerics, Gaussian Processes, and Numerical Methods. I am currently working on fast-solving related linear systems using various learning techniques. 


<!--- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.--->
